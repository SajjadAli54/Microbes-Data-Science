# Microbes-Data-Science
# Introduction of Dataset
Novel DNA sequencing technologies have proliferated over the past two decades. Continual
improvements in “next-generation sequencing” (NGS) and “third-generation sequencing” (TGS) have
increased the fidelity and rate of sequencing, but it still takes hours or days to obtain complete
sequences. Furthermore, there are some diagnostic applications in which very rapid identification of a
particular gene or genetic species becomes essential, while identification of all genes is not necessary.
For example, in patients with septic shock from bacterial infections, identification of antibiotic-
resistance genes is essential because the mortality rate increases 7.6% per hour of delay in
administering correct antibiotics. Unfortunately, it takes more than 24h to grow up the bacteria
recovered from the blood of an infected patient, identify the species, and then determine to which
antibiotics the organism is resistant, leading to a very high mortality rate for such infections. Bacterial
antibiotic resistance is becoming a significant health threat, and rapid identification of antibiotic-
resistant bacteria is essential to save lives and reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance. It is a dataset
for ten different micro-forms of life (Spirogyra, Volvox, Pithophora, Yeast, Raizopus, Penicillum,
Aspergillus sp, Protozoa, Diatom, Ulothrix).
